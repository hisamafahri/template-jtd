# Publishing the Docs

The most convinience way to publish the docs is [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) â€“ the [official README file](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md) explains in details how to do that.

But, you can also use any other hosting service that supports static sites.
