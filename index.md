Hello, world!

This is a minimum template for the [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) project.

## How do I Use It?

My intended purposes for this template is to have a great starting point for me and all of my personal, projects, or even work documentations purposes.

## How can I use it?

You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) â€“ the [official README file](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md) also explains how to do that, along with other details.
