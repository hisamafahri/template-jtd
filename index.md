# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

## What's this?

This is a minimum template for the [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) project.

## How do I Personally Use It?

My intended purpose for this template is to have a great starting point for me and all of my personal, projects, or even work documentation purposes.

## How do I (mostly) Structured It?

I am a huge fan of [DiÃ¡taxis](https://diataxis.fr) framework for documentation strategy. It mostly split it into Tutorials, How-to Guides, References, and Explanations/Concepts. 

While its initial purpose was to be used in technical documentation, I found it to be suitable with a wide range of documents with little to no adjustments.

## How can I use it?

Follow the guides, [here](/docs/tutorials)!
